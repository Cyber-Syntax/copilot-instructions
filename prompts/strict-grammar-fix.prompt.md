# Strict Grammar Fix

Correct the grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes in the following text while **preserving** the original wording, structure, markdown syntax, and any special characters or placeholders (e.g., `%1`, `${variable}`).

Do **not** rephrase, reorganize, or adjust the tone. Focus only on fixing technical errors that violate standard English grammar rules.

Provide the corrected version without additional notes or explanations.
