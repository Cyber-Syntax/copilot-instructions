# Project documentation writing guidelines

## Documentation Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Beginner-friendly** | Non-developers should understand core concepts |
| **Copy-paste success** | Code examples must run with minimal setup |
| **Less text, more interaction** | Prefer components over long paragraphs |
| **Show, don't tell** | Use diagrams, tabs, and accordions to explain |
| **Few lines, big impact** | Examples should feel like "only 3 lines to do this" |


## General Guidelines

- Write clear and concise documentation.
- Use consistent terminology and style.
- Include code examples where applicable.

## Grammar
- Use present tense verbs (is, open) instead of past tense (was, opened).
- Write factual statements and direct commands. Avoid hypotheticals like "could" or "would".
- Use active voice where the subject performs the action.
- Write in second person (you) to speak directly to readers.

## Markdown Guidelines

- Use headings to organize content.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include links to related resources.
- Use code blocks for code snippets.
